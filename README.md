## Introduction
- Market opportunity has been generated due to the rise in e-commerce activity over the past several years.
- But low conversion rates mean that innovative approaches are needed to reach today's digital consumers with relevant offers. 
- An experienced salesperson at a physical or offline store can use their knowledge to provide consumers with individualised recommendations. Time efficiency, sales, and profits all benefit from this knowledge to varying degrees. 
- Companies in the fields of E-commerce and information technology spend a lot of money on early detection and behavioural prediction algorithms that attempt to mimic the actions of a human salesman in an online store. 
- Due to this trend, several academic research employing machine learning techniques have been proposed to investigate the issue from various vantage points. 
- Some studies focus on classifying visits based on the consumer's navigational patterns

## 1. Used Dataset:
### Online Shopper Intention Dataset
- The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions.
- The data set is a set of 18 features: 10 numerical and 8 categorical.
- Dataset is split into 10,422 entries where the shoppers did not purchase and 1908 entries where the shoppers did purchase. 
- The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.
